### Krampus-Keeb
An ortholinear, ergo, monoblock keyboard with some additional enhancements

Inspired by the Krampus, a half-man and half-goat, Bavarian match to Santa Claus, this keyboard is meant to inspire the badly behaved children inside of us all.

This project aims to create an alice-like, monoblock, lily58 inspired keyboard, with a center macro/num-pad, encoders, and LED. I'm also aiming to incorporate in a modular fashion a trackball and macOS compliant TouchID (fingerprint) sensor, that is all connected as its own device through an integrated USB-C based hub.
